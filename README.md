- My environmental global variables are in a .h instead of a file, but I've designed it so that it should be relatively easy to implement into a file.

- I need to refine the embed to be designed better, a better picture source and the text displays on the embed, I just wanted an embed to show.

- I have some naming conventions I need to go through and clarify, I use hero/villain interchangeably with blue/red.  I was attempting to design around allowing guilds to make their own faction names, but without the benefit of SQL knowledge/experience, I need to hold off on that for a while, so I'm converting all of my verbiage to hero/villain from red/blue.
